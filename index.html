      <p>Salmon Cookies started in Seattle area in 2015. The idea came through when two fishermen, Pat and Mat,  got home after fishing. They were cleaning the Salmons when Sam, their best friend, showed up to surprise Pat for his birthday. Guess what, Sam forgot to bring his birthday cake, so the only solution was to make it at home. As there was nothing at home except Salmon, flour, sugar and water, Pat and Mat thought why not making cookies with Salmon, however it might taste awful,  but might worth a try. SO, they made their own recipe and made the cookie. After serving the cake, guess who was surprised, Sam was surprised with those yummy cookies. The following day Pat and Mat started making other recipes. They started their first shop in July 2015, and have five franchises right now, which are spreading all over coders.</p>
